It covers The Highway Code, which includes the traffic rules, traffic regulations, traffic signs and signals, \nand it aims to educate and promote road safety for the road users. Many of the rules and regulations in the Code are legal requirements, \nand if you disobey them, you are committing a traffic offence. You may be fined and given demerit points on your driving licence, \nwhich may lead to suspension or revocation of your driving licence, or you may be disqualified by the Courts from driving. Knowing \nand applying the traffic rules and regulations in The Highway Code could significantly help to reduce road accidents, casualties and \nfatalities on our roads. \n \nWHAT IS A DRIVING LICENCE? \n1 \nA driving licence is a legal document issued by the Traffic Police under the Road Traffic Act, which identifies the licensee, sets \nout the class(es) of vehicle(s) which he/she may legally drive and states such restrictions or conditions as may apply as well as \nthe period for which the licence is valid, where applicable.",

You may cross the \ncentre line if the roads are narrow. \n \nLANE DISCIPLINE \n65 You must obey the directions indicated by arrows marked in the lanes. See illustration below.

For public notification, signboards are put up in the test areas to indicate that trials \nare being carried out. \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nHOW TO RECOGNISE AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON TRIAL? \n233 AVs that are approved by LTA for the purpose of trials on public roads are issued with permits and sport decals for easy \nrecognition by road users. \n \n \nHOW TO INTERACT WITH AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE ON TRIAL",

The correct attitude towards driving will make the road \na safer and more pleasant place. \n \n236 When you notice an AV being tested on the road, you should continue driving safely as you would normally do. You are advised \nto observe these simple driving practices: \n(a) Do not tailgate \n(i) Tailgating, or following too closely behind another vehicle is a dangerous practice.

The electricity is stored on \nboard in a rechargeable battery, which drives one or more electric motors.   \n \n238 Electric powered motorcycles and scooters are generally of the same size and weight and are comparable in performance with \npetrol driven motorcycles.    \n \nFEATURES OF ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLES \n239 The features of the electric motorcycles are similar to the petrol engine motorcycles. They generally have the same operating \nfunction such as brakes, mirrors, lights and etc.    \n \n240 The only difference is that electric motorcycle runs on automatic transmission gear without having the clutch which is used for \nmanual transmission motorcycles. Similarly, some petrol engine motorcycles and scooters presently runs on automatic \ntransmission.  \n \n241 Electric motorcycles have better acceleration as they develop higher torque. Generally electric motorcycles weigh lighter and \nhave a low engine noise.  \n \nCLASSES OF DRIVING LICENCES \n242 The following table is the categorisation of electric motorcycles with existing Class 2B, 2A and 2 categories under the law. \n \nLicence Class \nCategorisation for Petrol",

Practicing eco-driving \ncan reduce fuel consumption by up to 10% on average over time1. By observing just a few simple eco-driving steps, you can \nreduce fuel use and at the same time reduce vehicular emissions. This lets you play a part in saving the environment while \nsaving money! \n \nWhat is Eco-Driving? \n269 Eco-driving generally refers to the practice of handling one\u2019s vehicle in a manner that promotes fuel economy and reduces \nemissions. These include vehicle maintenance, on-road driver behaviour, and route selection. \n \nHow to ADOPT Eco-DRIVING \n270 Eco-driving is not difficult. You can lower your vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption and impact on the environment by observing these \nsimple driving practices: \n \n(a) Don\u2019t Leave Your Vehicle Engine idling \n(i) \nTurn off the engine when your vehicle is stationary for reasons other than traffic conditions. Idling engines waste fuel, \ngenerate unnecessary pollution to the environment, and cause fumes and noise nuisance to the public.",

Offenders are liable to a fine of up to $5,000, if \nconvicted in court. \n \n \n \n \n(ii) \nThere is no need to warm up the engine before driving off. Modern engines reach their optimal temperature faster when \nthe vehicle is driven at moderate speeds upon starting. \n \nTurn off the engine when your vehicle is stationary \n \n(b) Maintain Your Vehicle Regularly \n(i) \nService your vehicle regularly. A well maintained vehicle is more fuel efficient and emits less pollution on the road. \n(ii) \nCheck your vehicle\u2019s tyre pressure at least once a month. Correctly inflated tyres help reduce drag, improve fuel \neconomy and reduce pollution. So make sure your tyres are at their recommended pressure. \n(iii) \nAvoid over-loading your vehicle. Carrying excess weight in a vehicle increases fuel consumption and emissions. Heavy \nor large items, e.g. heavy tool kits, etc., should be removed from your vehicle when not required. \n \n \nEnsure that your vehicle\u2019s tyres are correctly inflated",

The majority of these cases \ntake place in carparks located in public housing estates. \n \n272 Similar to past trends, theft of motorcycles continue to form the majority (about two-thirds) of all theft of motor-vehicles reported \nto the police. Joyrides and transportation for personal uses continue to be common motives for stealing such vehicles. However, \nsome stolen vehicles are never recovered. \n \n273 Likewise, for theft from vehicles, common items stolen, especially from cars, are laptops, handbags, cash cards and handphones. \nThe culprit(s) usually smash the window or windscreen of the car in the dead of the night to gain access to the valuables left \nbehind by the owner. \n \n274 Therefore, it is every vehicle owner\u2019s responsibility to ensure the security of their vehicle and valuables kept within, in order to \nprevent such thefts from occurring. Future vehicle owners such as yourself, are encouraged to enhance the security of vehicles by \ntaking adequate crime prevention measures.",

However, riding on the road means \naccepting responsibility for yourself and showing due care and consideration for all other road users. Compared with \ndriving other vehicles, riding a motorcycle puts you at greater risk from other road users. Safe riding calls for total \nawareness of what other road users are doing and the ability to \u201ccommunicate\u201d with them. The correct attitude \ntowards riding will make the road a safer and more pleasant place for pedestrians and motorists alike. \n \nDuring the initial stages of learning. It is essential that learner riders cultivate the right qualities and learn the \nright techniques. Mistakes which are repeated will become habits which cannot be easily corrected. \n \nTRAFFIC ACCIDENTS \n1. \nAs compared to driving a car, motorcycle riding requires greater skills and control. A motorcyclist is also less visible \non the road, and is more prone to sustaining injuries in accidents, due to the lack of protection provided by an \nouter shell. \n \n2. \nRiding is a chain process involving perception, judgement and reaction.

The following explains general road behaviour and fundamentals of lane changing. \n \nROAD HOGGING \n143. Road-Hogging is driving at an unreasonably slow speed on the road especially on the right-hand or along \nthe centre of the road. Road-Hogging hinders the flow of traffic behind and may cause other vehicles to pass \ndangerously on the left. Motorists who travel at a slow speed should keep to the left side of the road; this \napplies especially to small capacity motorcycles, goods vehicles and lorries. You should only use the right-hand \nlane when overtaking or when you are about to turn right or make a U-turn. \n \nTHE KEEP LEFT RULE \n144. When driving along two-way streets, keep well to the left and as near as practicable to the boundary of the \nroad, except when you intend to overtake or turn right. Do not hog the middle of the road. This applies \nto dual- carriageways as well. \n \nYou must not cross the centre line at bends, near the crest of a rise or anywhere else where you cannot clearly \nsee the road ahead.",

You must not change lanes suddenly \nas you may inconvenience or endanger other \nmotorists. \nWhen \nchanging \nlanes, \ngive \nsufficient warning of your intention.

Traffic Police (TP) will deploy more traffic sensors, such as speed and red-light cameras to enhance road safety on \nthe roads.

The highly visible cameras will serve to deter the commission of traffic violations, thereby \nenhancing road safety. \n \nRED LIGHT CAMERAS \n284. To deter and detect motorists who endanger other road users by beating the red \nlights, a total of 240 digital red-light cameras have been installed island-wide as of \nJun 2015. \n \nTraffic junctions that do not have red light cameras installed are monitored by TP\u2019s \nmobile enforcement operations. Such locations are regularly evaluated so that they \nremain relevant. \n \nMotorists who beat red lights are liable for 12 demerit points and a fine of $400 to \n$500, depending on vehicle type. Any motorists who are charged in court are liable \nto a $1,000 fine or 3 months\u2019 imprisonment for the first offence, and a $2,000 fine \nor 6 months\u2019 imprisonment for a second or subsequent offence. \n \nFIXED SPEED CAMERAS",

These include the use of static digital speed \nenforcement cameras island-wide and the use of mobile speed laser cameras during \nanti-speed operations. In addition, patrol officers are continually on the lookout for \nspeedsters who drive dangerously. Motorists who commit speeding offences can be \nfined $150 to $400 and receive 4 to 24 demerit points. They may also be prosecuted \nin court. \n \nMOBILE SPEED CAMERAS \n286. TP is constantly exploring various technological solutions to complement its \nenforcement efforts. One option is the adoption of Mobile Speed cameras (MSCs). \n \nSimilar to the functions of fixed speed cameras, the MSCs are meant to be more \nmobile, and provide a more ad-hoc solution, being able to be deployed to certain \nareas that the current fixed speed cameras may not be able to. \n \nDeploying and redeploying of MSCs will be faster and more cost-effective than the \nfixed speed cameras, and also allow TP to respond promptly to curb localised and \nprolonged speeding problems, without compromising frontline resources from \nother TP operations. Painted in the same traffic-orange colours, the cameras \nwill act as deterrence to errant motorists and behaviours.",
